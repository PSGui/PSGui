Hi! I'm Guilherme and I am an aspiring electrical and computer engineering student diving into the world of coding. Currently hoaning programming skills at 42 School, specializing in C, C++ and web development. Alongside university studies encompassing microcontrollers, circuitry and AI, I'm eager to learn more about automation 🧑🏻‍💻

### • Languages and Tools

Most of these I only gave a small try at some point. At the moment C is the one I'm using on a daily basis.
